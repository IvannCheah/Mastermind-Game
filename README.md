# 🍇 Mastermind Fruit Game (Python)

Welcome to the **Mastermind Computer Game** — a simple terminal-based implementation of the classic Mastermind game using fruits!

## 📘 Introduction

This is my very first Python project developed during my time at university. The goal was to build a simple version of the classic **Mastermind** game — but with a fun twist using fruits 🍎🍊🥭🍇!

I created this game to practice Python fundamentals such as loops, functions, conditionals, and basic user input handling. It runs entirely in the terminal and offers a playful way to test your logic and guessing skills.

## 🎮 How to Play

- The computer will secretly choose **4 fruits** from:
  - `apple`, `orange`, `mango`, `grape`
- Your task is to guess the exact sequence.
- After each guess, the game will tell you:
  - How many fruits are correct and in the correct position.
  - How many fruits are correct but in the wrong position.

You win when you guess all 4 fruits in the correct order!

## ✅ Features

- Simple terminal-based interface
- Input validation
- Randomized secret codes
- Play-again option

## 🛠️ How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed. Then, in the terminal:

```bash
python Mastermindgame.py
